# Análisis comparativo entre optimización clásica y optimización metaheurística aplicado al Beamforming adaptativo de arreglos planos MIMO Masivo

In recent years, wireless networks have experienced exponential growth due to increasing research and new technologies in both hardware and software. However, this increase in devices poses several problems and challenges for the network, such as limited or non-existent coverage in rural or remote areas, signal interference due to electromagnetic interference or densely populated urban environments, privacy of transmitted data, and poor quality of service offered by mobile operators. To address these issues, the industry and scientific community are investigating various techniques, with Beamforming being the most suitable strategy in the context of fifth and sixth generation mobile telephony.

This thesis conducts a comparative analysis between classical optimization algorithms such as Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Nelder-Mead Search (NMS), and metaheuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Bat Algorithm (BA), and Cuckoo Search by Lévy Flights (CKLF). For this analysis, different test functions were selected in different dimensions and metrics. Stop criteria, maximum number of iterations, and success rate were established. In addition, the convergence order p was analyzed through the analysis of the Root Mean Squared Error time series.

The thesis also considers the model of Blind Adaptive Beamforming, where the information of the desired and interfering signal orientations is not available for the algorithm. A rectangular flat antenna with 64 radiating elements was used, and metrics such as the bandwidth of the average power in degrees, the radiation intensity of the main lobe, the depth of the first nulls, and the level of the side lobes were implemented, all in decibels. The results aim to improve spectral efficiency and service quality.
